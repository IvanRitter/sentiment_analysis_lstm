saying bought sony replace older sony cassette unit happens physical dimensions two almost exactly standard din size apparently connectors wiring identical made extremely simple installation case since able use harness dash adapter already installed although cannibalize side clips old unit mountings not took little time f5500 running indeed ease installation one primary factors influencing decision wanted unit would go existing mounting connect existing wiring factor course mp3 cd feature listen mp3 discs far often cassettes honest generally used cassette deck old unit nothing place plug audio adapter expanium br br already owned older sony stereo already familiar sonys crosskey controls tuning cd track selection however differences f5500 old unit comes setting preferences many rather nonintuitive required search manual information bit hard find tiny buttons options features involve simultaneously pressing knob various buttons would not give unit high marks ergonomics br br also ergonomics department mention faceplate takes practice comes attaching removing maybe stereo isnt fully broken yet tolerances seem rather tight sometimes take couple tries get faceplate latched properly though feels like wellmade pivots smoothly br br consider old unit phenomenal fm sensitivity eastern suburbs los angeles easily received many san diego stations said unit sonys terrific ssirex tuner section shines f5500 reception quite good well easily receive many distant stations western us denver albuquerque las vegas san francisco br br seen least one sellers description state

two seconds br br dozen mp3 discs withanywhere 140 200 tracks although certainly not yet played every one start finish discovered one track far f5500 not play dont know reason philips expanium 103
