note readers dont feel much like reading rants urc pro av dealers scroll heading review urc digital r50 handheld remote control think ok not fantastic like id hoped ergonomic design lacking decided make ambitious venture purchasing mx3000 use home theater system downstairs family room made purchase needed know could handle programming unit tried obtain mx3000 editor software next impossible obtain urc arrangement licensed av dealerships urc wont provide programming software end user even hardware urcs way helping av dealers make extra money offering programming services addition sale remote without software program unit option end user hire av professional program mx3000 cost several hundred dollars av professionals best scare end user saying extremely difficult program units not possible end user unless theyve extensive training urc nothing scare tactics try help av dealers preserve cash cow make matters worse av dealers tell cant provide software urc policies could lose license give software end user purely fallacious urc allows licensed dealers give software whomever choose dealers created boondoggle sources tried provide software openly anyone everyone wishes made dealers furious dealers threatened abandon urc product line think urc nothing protect boondoggle urc hired lawyers go parties providing software unauthorized internet channels not licensed urc dealers dealers crying boondoggle threatened interesting dealers made pretty insulting remarks towards people remote perfectly capable programming dont want pay cash cow av professionals feverishly protecting add insult injury many instances dealer may not get mx3000 programmed quite right works might little buggy not operating optimally ive read reviews owners remote wish theyd never bought unit wasted 1000 purchasing one say doesnt work smoothly theyve thought throwing trash theyre tired calling av dealer back etc perhaps software willing take time tweak programming little perform tuneups wouldnt unhappy dont think dealer get mx3000 tuned perfectly works precisely way want hundred dollars worth programming need able go back several times mess programming get working smoothly period days weeks frankly not cost effective dealer thorough addition av dealers know no one home system remains unchanged time know next time upgrade part system even want make minor changes system way remote control works existing system pay av dealer another fee modify mx3000 programming painful ones wallet however people no problem spending money spend av dealers know wonder company would force people buy product pay additional money 3rd party make product work may situations people cant dont want programming not let people want programming dont pay professional done force perfectly capable pay programming one high end dealer made remark internet forum potential customer starts inquiring software starts asking us get software purchase unit try negotiate programming fee really dont want business customer attitude av professionals seems similar remark rarely might come across dealer isnt quite scheming tight business practices give software purchase new urc product might even answer questions run problems programming unit prepared pay quite price new unit 6001000 programming extra well say near impossible obtain programming software mx3000 like cartel fort knox something youre thinking buying one new used ebay amazon make sure inquire whether comes cd words mx3000 editor labeled disk need program mx3000 remote control ask lot questions lot sellers buying ok please accept apology getting soapbox ranting get chest needed said since racket disturbing actual review opinion mx3000 review purchased brand new mx3000 internet not dealer installed editor software pc windows xp no troubles except would not update urc website get latest ir database program revisions turned antivirus program update completed ready start programming actually programming interface quite

mx3000 first attempt got mx3000 programmed set way wanted btw took week fine tune everything get little kinks make work smoothly feeling good price paid ease programming pretty sure no av dealer would willing spend time fine tuning giving attention details way custom graphics sounds macros unless course pay additional monies changes programming well av installer know entire system selling remote looking want control hour unless course sold whole av system programming finished working well say not extremely impressed mx3000 gave 3 stars review certainly not programming issues following reasons based experiences past month usage really glad didnt spend hundreds dollars unit got lucky picked someone bought decided wanted something else dumped cheap brand new box five disappointing impressions mx3000 1 ergonomics unit looks slick impressive sitting coffee table like like use remote one hand without looking wont able mx3000 even remotes urc sells like mx800 900 series traditional onehanded style remotes screen display going problem mx3000 far ergonomics go lets say average person likes hold remote hand youre channel surfing youve pretty much memorized key locations remote typically look tv screen pressing buttons remote isnt ergonomically possible mx3000 touch screen remote look display page screens touch right soft key screen requires focus screen cannot operate unit one hand unless set surface push keys one finger no thumbfinger action like cell phone hard keys things like volume mute channel cursor left right menu button exit button 2 battery life moderate use unit need charging every day half depending screen time usage screen timeout set 30seconds unit drains amount power screen however takes couple hours recharge unit highly recommend not leave unit charging cradle times wear battery faster youll end buy another liion battery year according experiences ive read users mx3000 sources tell ok leave unit charging cradle times smart charger wont overcharge battery doesnt quite explain users replace battery within year said battery pack swelled cracked went replace folks said left mx3000 charging cradle constantly cost new battery 15 20 shipping amazon ebay work fine make sure order one right connector two styles pay attention mx3000 buying 3 autoon feature normally would great feature one hand really like feature unit setting table pick unit turns instantly internal motion sensor detects movement unit however means holding lap set sofa beside going keep coming every time move little runs battery fairly quick wow factor loses appeal realize often needs charging may encourage leave unit charging cradle time shorten life battery screen comes cannot manually shut back wait screen timeout elapses according length time selected settings see next disappointing comment 4 no screen key would much prefer mx3000 would designed pushbutton screen onoff key turn manually instead waiting screen timeout elapse even soft key programming options would great urc hasnt allowed reason dilemma set screen autooff time short keep turning back using remote set timeout longer navigate screens figure want theater system set table stays autooff timeout elapsed not good design depletes battery urc r50 problem id like able turn screen manually urc would read review could easily add command feature programming would allow user turn mx3000 screen would allow user save lot battery power charges things easy make much sense get overlooked design teams sitting ivory towers 5 additional updates editor software cannot updated first time perform live update editor displays message try update first update saying software no longer updated contact distributor sales rep blah blah blah says must complete control suite not ccp ccs obtain additional live updates mx3000 urc products urc trying force end user pay additional money pro av dealer ccs software updated pros remote not difficult program computer skills reasonably knowledgeable home theater system works looks impressive sitting coffee table touch screen nice works fairly well learning feature allows user program unit pointing old remotes mx3000 button command learned stored editor software cool sounds programmed buttons macro sequences import graphics total customization programmable anything w macro feature including lighting room clock display current time programmed appear screen mx3000 new unit bought ebay amazon much cheaper licensed av dealer cons not one handed remote not ergonomically designed nolook operation battery life not great could easily better see comment 4 touchscreen not good todays smartphones screen resolution touch sensitivity low quality no screen key lack feature drains battery see comment 4 screen keeps turning autoon enabled see comment 3 software extremely hard obtain not provided purchase software cannot updated first live update unless additional ccs software builtin graphics included software undesirable cheesy looking plain boring pro av dealers try make feel like criminal buy anyone licensed dealer pro av dealers gouge customers programming costs free one really good thing want say buy amazon pretty much golden take care problems treat kinds respect want return unit get refund cant dont want program unit not hard computer skills make sure licensed dealer nearby provide programming services fee
